 - This project specifically focuses on applying sentiment analysis to financial news to understand market sentiment and potential impact
 on stock prices.

### Features
 - Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization)
 - Sentiment classification using various machine learning models
 - Evaluation of model performance
 - Visualization of sentiment trends

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project has been borrowed from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurzing/sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news), consisting of financial news articles from various sources. The data includes:

News headlines and articles
Labeled sentiment (if available)

### Models
The project implements and compares several machine learning models for sentiment analysis:


### Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
